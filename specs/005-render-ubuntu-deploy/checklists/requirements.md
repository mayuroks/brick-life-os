> **[LEGACY/ARCHIVED] — historical spec for a retired host path, superseded by the EC2 single-box native deploy (`deploy/ec2-single-box/` + `deploy/README.md`). Kept as audit history — do not follow. Region is `ap-south-1`, host is a 1GB+2GB-swap `t3.micro`.**

# Specification Quality Checklist: Render Ubuntu Cloud Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is treated as the base OS (user's explicit choice; released as of this spec's date).
- Voice transcription is explicitly IN cloud scope here (differs from the local-only scope of feature 004).
- Resource-limit and architecture (amd64) constraints are surfaced as edge cases + assumptions, not
  buried in hazy language.
